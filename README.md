# <h1 align="center" >My solana projects</h1>

I have built several Blockchain projects! My skills cover a wide range of features and functionalities, including minting, staking, evolution/breeding, raffle/auction houses, Launchpad, Marketplace, and P2E games such as dice, crash, jackpot, coinflip, and more. I look forward to learning more about the specific details of new skills.
